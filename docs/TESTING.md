# Testing / QA

## Linux — validated 2026-11-01 (on an internal Ubuntu 24.04 host)

A full QA pass on a clean machine. All green.

### Clean one-command install
`./install.sh` from a wiped `$PI_AGENT_HOME`, all 9 stages end to end:

```
preflight (skips apt when deps present) → node 22.23.4 → fetch (plugins +
settings-patch sha256 verified) → piweb (built from source, Omnigent/Paseo
routes compiled, CJK patch applied) → clis (claude 2.1.296 + codex 0.162.1) →
paseo (@getpaseo/cli 0.11.2) → omnigent (0.16.0 uv venv) → wire (settings.json
auto-registers both plugins) → service (systemd --user, enabled + started)
done: preflight node fetch piweb clis paseo omnigent wire service
```

### Smoke test (`tests/smoke-linux.sh`) — 24 passed, 0 failed
- **versions**: pi 1.4.0, claude 2.1.296, codex 0.162.1
- **service**: active + enabled (survives boot)
- **http**: `/`, `/api/home`, `/omnigent` all 200
- **plugin state**: `settings.json` registers both plugins; `/api/omnigent`
  reports `active:true`, 3 engines, version 0.3.31
- **skill sharing**: a skill under `data/skills/` is visible through
  `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.pi/agent/skills`, and `~/.agents/skills`
- **MCP sharing**: an http + a stdio server from `data/mcp.json` land in both
  `~/.claude.json` and `~/.codex/config.toml`; `claude mcp list` lists them;
  removing one prunes it from both (managed-marker tracking)
- **restart**: pi-web serves again after `systemctl --user restart`

Run it yourself:
```bash
bash tests/smoke-linux.sh    # exits non-zero on any failure
```

### Browser verification (real Chromium, over an SSH tunnel to localhost:30141)
- Settings dialog renders all 8 tabs: 一般 · 模型 · 技能 · 子代理 · 外掛 · MCP ·
  **Omnigent** · **Paseo**. UI is Traditional Chinese.
- The **Omnigent** tab is fully populated: connection form + the three detected
  engines (Claude Code 2.1.296, Codex 0.162.1, Pi Agent 1.4.0) + the
  conversation-verification panel. (Before the `settings.json` fix it showed
  "插件已停用".)

### Known-remaining (need external input, not installer bugs)
- **Live Omnigent connect** needs an Omnigent **server URL + account/password**.
- **Model availability** ("0 個模型") needs model auth: `claude auth login` /
  `codex login` (the user's own accounts) or an Omnigent server connection.
- **macOS** is gated on the plugin portability item — see `DESIGN.md` §6.
- **Windows (WSL2)** reuses this exact Linux path; pending a test target.

## Pi → LiteLLM gateway — validated 2026-11-01

Wired with `pi-agent-litellm set --base-url <gw>/v1 --key-stdin` against the
WOOWTECH PaaS LiteLLM release (a per-workspace `paas-ws-*` Helm release reached
over its public hostname). The key lands in `$PI_AGENT_HOME/litellm.env`
(mode 600) and `models.json` references it as `${LITELLM_API_KEY}`, so no
credential is stored in `models.json`.

Verified on the Linux host:
- `pi auth check --provider litellm --json` → `{"status":"ready","authType":"api_key"}`
- `pi --list-models` lists all **81** gateway models
- **Conversation + model switching**: four different models each returned their
  own distinct expected string —
  `apporo/gpt-6-astra`, `apporo/gpt-6-sol`, `chatgpt-pool/gpt-6-sol`,
  `qwen3-4b-cluster1` (a local GPU endpoint behind the gateway).
- Select with the provider prefix: `pi --model litellm/apporo/gpt-6-astra`.
  Ids keep their slashes because that is what goes on the wire.

### Findings worth knowing
1. **Most gateway models fail for upstream billing/quota reasons, not wiring.**
   Probing all 81: **24 answer**. The rest fail upstream —
   `woowtech/claude-*` and `anthropic/*`: Anthropic credit exhausted;
   `chatgpt/*`: `usage_limit_reached`; anything routed through OpenRouter
   (`deepseek/*`, `z-ai/*`, `openai/*` per `/model/info`): HTTP 402
   "upstream provider declined for a billing reason".
   Reliable groups observed: `apporo/gpt-*`, `chatgpt-pool/gpt-*`,
   `qwen3-4b-*` (local GPU), several `:free` models.
2. **`settings.json` `defaultModel` is ignored by `pi -p`** (pi 1.4.0). Print
   mode falls back to automatic selection, which takes the alphabetically first
   catalog entry — `anthropic/claude-fable-5.1` here, one of the no-credit ones.
   Pass `--model` explicitly, or keep no-credit models out of the gateway.
3. **Omnigent's `pi` engine stays `MODELS_UNAVAILABLE` even though Pi works.**
   `pi-omnigent-plugin/src/runtime.mjs` refreshes the Pi model list only when
   `nativePiLoginFingerprint()` finds a **non-empty `auth.json`** — i.e. an
   interactive `pi /login`. A gateway configured through `models.json` (the
   documented way to add a compatible endpoint) never trips that gate, so
   Omnigent reports no models for `pi` while `pi auth check` says `ready` and
   conversations work. Upstream fix would be to also accept a
   models.json-configured provider (or consult `pi auth check`).
   Claude and Codex are unaffected: both are `ready=true verified=true`
   (4 and 8 models) after their own provider sign-ins.
